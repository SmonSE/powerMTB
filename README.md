# PowerMTB SimpleDataField for Edge130

## TRAIN BY WATTS

The trend in cycling is that the current performance is measured in watts/kg. This allows a relatively accurate evaluation, 
with which training progress can be measured. Watt measuring systems offer clear advantages compared to a training analysis via the heart rate, 
but are quite expensive and therefore mainly found in amateur and professional areas.
Since I don't want to spend the money for such a power meter at the moment (> 500â‚¬), I'm trying to develop a data field for my Garmin Edge 130, 
which calculates this power and displays it in plausible values.

I compared the watt calculation with a roller trainer and Zwift, where I calculate identical values on the flat and without a headwind.
The biggest problem at the moment is that I can't include the wind force (headwind) in my calculations. 
There are devices on the market that integrate such values using sensors, which the Edge unfortunately does not provide.
